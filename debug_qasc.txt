Pred:  The liver is the largest organ in the human body. It is located in the upper right portion of the abdomen, beneath the diaphragm, and on top of the stomach, right kidneys, and intestines. The liver's main job is to filter the blood coming from the digestive tract, before passing it to the rest of the body. The liver also detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes drugs. As it does so, the liver secretes bile that ends up back in the intestines. The liver also makes proteins important for blood clotting and other functions. The liver stores glycogen (a starch), which is made from excess sugar in the blood, and releases it as needed. The liver also makes cholesterol and special proteins needed to help transportation of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins in the body. The liver breaks down (metabolizes) hormones and any toxic substances that enter the body. It also neutralizes alcohol and can assist in filtering out alcohol from the blood. The liver is also important for the metabolism of amino acids. The liver is the only internal organ capable of regenerating itself. The liver is the largest gland and organ in the human body. It performs many important functions and plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy body. The liver is the largest gland and organ in the human body.
